I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Aalborg University, Denmark, specializing in fine-grained video understanding and foundation models. During my PhD, I focused on understanding images and videos under limited label constraints, with a particular emphasis on video anomaly detection—a domain where labeling data is a challenging and tedious task. I was honored to receive the [Spar Nord Forskning Prize 2024](https://www.aau.dk/om-aau/profil/priser-og-haeder/spar-nord) for my extraordinary research at Aalborg University.

My research interests encompass video understanding at both high and low levels, including anomaly detection, video instance segmentation, and self-supervised learning.
